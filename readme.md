CSC 102 Final Project: Bomb Defusal

Project Ideas 4/2:
-when completing a phase get extra time
-each phase gives some sort of clue to a digit in the combination
-some of indicator for what phase youre in
-keypad has long combination but correlates to the letters

-colors parent phases
    -green phase consists of a toggle, wire, and keypad phase,
    -red phase
    -blue phase

-1 minute for each color phase
-15 seconds added for solving toggle or wire
-30 seconds added for entire color phase solved

-prompt questions on the GUI that you can answer with a number
-trivia game

-trivia related to wire colors
-jersey/team colors need to be connected to get the code

-buttons relate to binary combination

-2 strikes per color phase

-some sort of randomness?


Project Ideas 4/4:
-KEEP BUTTON
-show the color phase on GUI
-keep the button as another component
-green = go, red = stop
-could use button as a way to give hints, take time off clock for this

-Keep each sub-phase (toggles, wires button) the same functionality but randomise the answer
-give less and less time for each color phase

rng factor, button could randomly change something on the gui that you have to match to something

-Button Phase Ideas:
have button stay red, randomly flashes green, if player pushes button while its green it will stay green and be "defused"
counting button presses, how many time you have to press button
toggles could be multiple choice questions, a, b, c, d whatever the answers are correlate to a binary number and thats how many times you need to push button
rng factor, button could randomly change something on the gui that you have to match to something

Project Plan:
-Have an overall theme could be trivia based
-Tie all puzzles into the theme
-maybe use binary, randomess, and basic caeser shift
